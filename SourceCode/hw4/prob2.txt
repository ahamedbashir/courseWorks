in terms of recognizeability of image with all kernels. Artifacts using box filter is 
the most noticeable, pixel to pixel transition is not smooth since the intermediate values 
are not interpolated between two neighboring pixels but instead replicated from the nearest neighbor. 
On the other hand using triangle filter linearly interpolates the in-between values and transitions 
are comparably smooth. However compared to cubic convolution, a lot f detail is lost due to this 
linearity and relatively simple transition from one pixel to another. Cubic and windowed functions 
achieve better, more desirable results. Also worth noting that for 2x and 4x magnification there are 
far less pixels interpolated (or replicated) than for 10x hence the substantial increase in artifacts.

When minification occurs we always lose information. This is far more noticeable in high frequency 
images such as star than low frequency images such as ramp when using box filter. 
The reason behind this difference is in sampling. When we sample an image, any 
information in between the sampling points is lost. Naturally if this in-between 
information is large (in case of high frequency image) it is more noticeable versus 
when this information is very close to that of sampled values.
