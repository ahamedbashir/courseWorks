We know that convolution of impulse signal with a kernel returns the kernel itself. 
So magnifying with each kernel should give us a signal that has a shape of kernel used. 
The graphs in xls file demonstrate exactly that phenomenon.

For minification our input is 128 samples and output is 16 samples. 
We are sampling at every 8th position. 8 also happens to be the period of our input signal, 
which is why our output consists of same numbers periodically repeated in the original signal.
