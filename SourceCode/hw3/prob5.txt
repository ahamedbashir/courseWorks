	All the plots are in prob5.xlsx file with 9 different sheets for probem 5a to 5h

	a)
		The input signal is just a single impulse and others are constant(zero).
		The magnitude function is a constant function as the magnitude and the width are inversely proportional 
		leading to a constant zero frequency domain in magnitude spectra.



	b)
		As the input signal is a box filter with a width of 16 located at the middle of the range [0,255], 
		the magnitude function is a "sinc" function because box filter translates into sinc function in frequency domain. 
		It is centered at 0 and has a period of 256.




	c)
		Just like b(x), this is also a box filter with 32 width, double the width of b(x). 
		Because of the width being twice that of b, the sinc function in frequency domain shrinks and increases in magnitude.




	d)
		Since the input signal is constant(1), the fft is just the impulse function at zero frequency, 
		and and the amplitude of the impulse is constant vlaue.




	e)
		This input signal is has addition consine function with the original box filter from b. because of that, 
		the magnitude has only two pulses at positive and negative frequency of the cos function. 
		Becase of the box filter alongside the cosine function, the magnitude function still has the properties of a   sinc function.




	f)
		This input signal is just a multiple of b(x). because of that, the mangnitude only changes by the constant amplitude. 
		Even though the phase spectrum didn't change, the overall spectrum has changed due to the scaling properties of the frequency domain.



	g)
		The input signal is linearly shifted to left from b(x). the the magnitude function acts like a circular function, 
		the frequency of the signal didn't change, the overall magnitude didn't change either. But the phase spectrum had 
		changed due to the position leading to overall change of the total spectrum.


	h_row_1d_scaline)
		The input signal is the 128th of the mandril image. as the input signal has different input frequencies such as 
		the nose area as low frequency change, and the hairs has high frequency. the magnitude is low in nature because of that. 
		However the spectrum changes with high range due to the relative brightness of those pixel

	h_circ_32_shift)
		This is exactly the same magnitude as the input signal is the circularly shifted row from h_row of mandril. 
		As a result, there is no difference in magnitude spectrum , but the phase spectrum is different due to the positon of the phase being moved. 
		The only pattern I see is that phase spectrum always changes base on the input signal, making it the most important spectrum.
