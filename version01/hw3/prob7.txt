Problem 7: Swapping

	From the reconstructed images after fourier transformation and swapping 
	the image phase spectrum, we see that the visual images switched based on
	the original phase.

	So, even though magnitude spectrum is part of the image, Phase is the most 
	pronounced spectrum of the FFT. One of the main reason for that is the shift 
	in Sinusoid of the image which is determined by Phase values. So, the phase 
	is most important spectrum to preserve the image.
